Wordpress + MediaWiki bridge by Mauro Colella, based on a work by Ciaran Gultniks.

## Discussion

## References
* Wikiful for Wordpress http://wordpress.org/plugins/wikiful/

## TODO

* A centralized installer, from inside WordPress.
* Automatically check that the .htaccess file of the master WordPress installation does not interfere.
* Automatically rewrite the .htaccess if necessary.
* Include wiki base instead of proxy (see Wikiful Plugin).
* Review additional plugins which could help with the implementation, notably:
    * A way to have discussion pages held in WordPress.
    * A way to integrate the Mediawiki search.
    * Random pages.
    * etc.
