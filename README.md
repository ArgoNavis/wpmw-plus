WPMW+

Wordpress + MediaWiki bridge by Mauro Colella, based on a work by Ciaran Gultniks.

## Discussion
http://wordpress.org/plugins/wikiful/

## References
* Wikiful for Wordpress http://wordpress.org/plugins/wikiful/

## TODO

* Automatically check that the .htaccess file of the master Wordpress installation does not interfere, automatically rewrite if necessary.
* Include instead of proxy (see Wikiful).
* Review additional plugins which could help with the implementation, notably:
    * A way to have discussion pages held in Wordpress.
    * A way to integrate the Mediawiki search, existing search plugins.
    * Random pages.
    * etc.
